# Project-Zero

### User Stories:

- The game is a very simple version of a speed typing game. You get a random word to type in the input as fast as you can.
- We have a timer on a corner/side that will begin counting down from 10 secs.
- We have a score on the other side to keep track of it.
- Each time you finish typing a word it will add time to the timer. As well as the score will increase by 1.
- The goal is to type as many words as possible before the time is up.
- When the time is up there is a window with the total of your score.
