# Project-Zero

# User Stories:

- The game is a very simple version of a speed typing game. You get a random word to type in the input as fast as you can.

- We have a timer on a corner/side that will begin counting down from 10 secs.

- We have a score on the other side to keep track of it.

- Each time you finish typing a word it will add time to the timer. As well as the score will increase by 1.

- The goal is to type as many words as possible before the time is up.

- When the time is up there is a window with the total of your score.


# Stretch Goals:

- Start timer only when user starts typing

- Switch to different background colors

- Highlight correct & incorrect words
